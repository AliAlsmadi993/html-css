<H1>ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS</H1>
<H2>QUESTIONS 1 : Can we place a &ltform&gt inside another  &ltform&gt?*
</H2>
<h3>We can't do that because it's against HTML standards and will lead to unexpected behavior like: </h3>


    <form action="" >
      <input type="text" name="outer">
    
      <form action="" >
        <input type="text" name="inner"><br>
        <button type="submit">Submit Inner Form</button>
      </form>
    
      <button type="submit">Submit Outer Form</button>
    </form>

<h2>if we need to create a form within a form, we resort to division but it is sent in one go</h2>

<form action="" >
<fieldset>
    <input type="text" name="inner" >
    <button type="submit">Submit Inner Form</button>
</fieldset>
<fieldset>
    <input type="text" name="outer">
    <button type="submit">Submit Outer Form</button>
</fieldset>
</form>
<h2>Q2.A.What happens if there is more than one submit button in the same form? </h2>
<p>The form will still function normally, but the button that is pressed will determine the data<br> that is submitted. If there is more than one submit button, the browser will submit the data<br> based on which button was selected.</p>
